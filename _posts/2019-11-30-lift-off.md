## Lift off!

![I officially launched my blog]({{site.baseurl}}/img/lift_off.jpg)

I finally managed to get my own blog up and running. And it took me less than 10 minutes to do it thanks to jekyll and [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) plugin.

There are still a few things to tweak but I am happy with having this out of the way.
